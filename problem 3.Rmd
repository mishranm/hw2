**Write a function in R to solve the following problem: One dollar invested at an annual rate of *r* percent compounded monthly for *m* months is worth**

$$ (1+\frac{r}{1200})^{m} $$

```{r, echo=TRUE}
compound<-function(r,m){
  total<-(1+(r/1200))^m
  return(total)
}
```

How much will one dollar be worth at the end of 6 years at 6% interest?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
compound(6,72)
```

How much will it be if interest rate was 17%?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
compound(17,72)
```
