**A monthly loan payment is computed from the principle of the loan, *p*, the number of years of payments *y*, and the interest rate in percent *i*, according to the formula **

$$ payment= p*\frac{(\frac{i}{1200})(1+\frac{i}{1200})^{12*y}}{(1+\frac{i}{1200})^{12*y}-1} $$

Write an R function to carry out this computation. What would the monthly payment be for a $150,000 mortgage at 6.5% for 30 years?


```{r}
payment<-function(p,y,i){
  nu<-(i/1200)*(1+(i/1200))^(12*y)
  de<-((1+(i/1200))^(12*y))-1
  total<-p*(nu/de)
  return(total)
}
```
```{r}
payment(150000,30,6.5)
```
